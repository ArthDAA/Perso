Hello!

Welcome to my personal work folder. Here, you'll find basically work I 
do for improving my skills. I know it's basic, but hey, everyone start from somewhere. 


You'll find here:

  - 42 : I did, in September 2024, the 42 School "piscine". And, followind my failure, I wanted to
  redo the exercices, so next time, I would have less surprise and the piscine could be easier for me.
  
  - begc4d : basically my saves from the "Beginning programing with C for dummies", the book.
  
  - more : random things that goes through my mind.


Feel free to say if I made  mistakes, i'm a beginner so every advices are welcome ^^ You can contact me through Discord, i'm `arthdaa06` !


(btw i'm french, so you know why I make big english mistkes, and why the begc4d codes are french.)
